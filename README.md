## ðŸ†ŽAbout

**"SUA LOJA"** application is an e-commerce app designed to assist micro-entrepreneurs in small towns to enter the digital market. It was developed using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. The main objective is to provide a ready-to-use software solution that is generic, uniform, and scalable.

The application offers two types of access: manager and customer. Managers have full control over all actions within the application, while customers use it to make purchases. For data storage, we utilize the Firebase tool, where product, customer, and administrator information are stored.

During the application development, we followed the principles of off-the-shelf software development. This means that we aimed to create a solution that could be applied in a generic, comprehensive, and large-scale manner.
